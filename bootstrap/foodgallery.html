                <h4>Fried Rice</h4> <br>
                Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually
                mixed
                with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. ... Fried rice first developed during
                the
                Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice.
